# getcleandata
Repository for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

Creates a tidy data set of wearable computing data originally from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
	
## Files in this repo
* README.md -- you are reading it right now
* CodeBook.md -- codebook describing variables, the data and transformations
* run_analysis.R -- actual R code
	
## run_analysis.R does the following (from assignment promtp)
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
	
It should run in a folder of the Samsung data (the zip had this folder: UCI HAR Dataset)
The script assumes it has in it's working directory the following files and folders:
* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* test/
* train/

The output is created in working directory with the name of tidy2.txt
	
## run_analysis.R notes
* The script meets the goals stated in the assignment by importing and merging the data, extracting the desired mesasurements, assigns names and labels, and ultimately creates a tidy datset and writes it to a file.
